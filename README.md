# FEM-POD-Steady_NS
This repository contains a reduced order model using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). As an example we chose the standard 2D cavity flow (steady Navier-Stokes equation). The problem states as follows: Find $(\mathbb{u},p)$ such that:
\begin{equation*}
   \mathbb{u\cdot\nabla u} - \nu\Delta\mathbb{u} + \nabla p = 0
\end{equation*}
